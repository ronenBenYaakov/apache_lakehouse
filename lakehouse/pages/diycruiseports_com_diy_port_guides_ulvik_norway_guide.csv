Ulvik Norway,9,https://diycruiseports.com/diy-port-guides/ulvik-norway-guide,p,"Ulvik is a tender port. Your ship will not dock at a pier but will anchor in the serene waters of theUlvikfjordenor the sheltered Ulvikpollen basin. The journey to get here is an experience in itself—a stunning six-hour sail-in from the open sea, navigating deep into the Hardangerfjord, also known as the “Queen of the Fjords“. Do spend some time on deck to watch the sail-in!"
Ulvik Norway,9,https://diycruiseports.com/diy-port-guides/ulvik-norway-guide,p,"Small tender boats, often the ship’s lifeboats, will ferry you ashore. You’ll disembark at theUlvik Tender Pier, which is conveniently located right in the heart of the village, directly in front of the historicBrakanes Hotel. You’ll see this marked on myUlvik Cruise Port mapbelow."

Ulvik Norway,9,https://diycruiseports.com/diy-port-guides/ulvik-norway-guide,p,"In keeping with its “Cittaslow” spirit of “slow living“, Ulvik is best explored using your own power!"
Ulvik Norway,9,https://diycruiseports.com/diy-port-guides/ulvik-norway-guide,p,"Note that there’s very few taxis in Ulvik, given how small the town is. If you’d like to get a taxi to do your own excursion, then your best bet is to ask at Brakanes Hotel, the hotel at Ulvik cruise pier, to call one for you."
Ulvik Norway,9,https://diycruiseports.com/diy-port-guides/ulvik-norway-guide,h2,Ulvik Norway: Top Things to Do on Foot from Cruise Pier
Ulvik Norway,9,https://diycruiseports.com/diy-port-guides/ulvik-norway-guide,h3,1. Walk Norway’s Only Fruit and Cider Route 🍎
Ulvik Norway,9,https://diycruiseports.com/diy-port-guides/ulvik-norway-guide,p,"This is Ulvik’s star attraction and you can do this as a DIY shore excursion! As Norway’s only officially designatedFruit and Cider Route, there’s three family-run farms interconnected on this walkable trail."
Ulvik Norway,9,https://diycruiseports.com/diy-port-guides/ulvik-norway-guide,p,You can walk to the first one (ie. the closest one from Ulvik tender pier) along “Apalvegen” (Apple Road) in under 30 minutes through blooming orchards and stunning fjord vistas. The other two farms are nearby.
Ulvik Norway,9,https://diycruiseports.com/diy-port-guides/ulvik-norway-guide,p,"Farms‘Opening Dates:Note that these farms typically only open from mid-June to mid-August. If your port day is in late August or later, you should double-check opening hours using the links I provided below, before attempting to walk to the farms. Alternatively stop by the tourist information office, marked on myUlvik Cruise Port mapand ask before you start walking!"
Ulvik Norway,9,https://diycruiseports.com/diy-port-guides/ulvik-norway-guide,p,"Each farm offers a different window into the world of Hardanger cider, a protected designation of origin similar to Champagne. You can visit their farm shops, and during the summer season, most offer drop-in “cider planks” (tasting flights) and scheduled guided tours."
Ulvik Norway,9,https://diycruiseports.com/diy-port-guides/ulvik-norway-guide,p,The three farms are:
Ulvik Norway,9,https://diycruiseports.com/diy-port-guides/ulvik-norway-guide,p,"From Ulvik Tender Pier, walk along the waterfront promenade, last Ulvik Church. Then continue along the waterfront “Tyssevikegen” until you see the turnoff with a sign “Frukt-og siderrute” (Fruit and Cider Route). Follow the road and you’ll be on “Apalvegen” (Apple Road). You’ll then reach theUlvik Frukt & Ciderifarm first."
Ulvik Norway,9,https://diycruiseports.com/diy-port-guides/ulvik-norway-guide,p,"From Ulvik Tender Pier to Ulvik Frukt & Cideri (the first farm along Apple Road), it’s about a 30 minute walk. Most of the walk is on flat ground but there’s some gentle inclines along the way. There’s no pedestrian pavement on the road but you’ll find that there’s very little car traffic that it’s not an issue to walk along the road at all."
Ulvik Norway,9,https://diycruiseports.com/diy-port-guides/ulvik-norway-guide,p,"So be aware that it’s an hour return trip to the closest farm. You don’t have to visit all three but if you’d like to do that, the walk back from the furthest farm to Ulvik Tender Pier would be 45 minutes one-way."
Ulvik Norway,9,https://diycruiseports.com/diy-port-guides/ulvik-norway-guide,h3,2. Experience the Fjord’s Majesty on a RIB Safari 🚤
Ulvik Norway,9,https://diycruiseports.com/diy-port-guides/ulvik-norway-guide,p,"For a dose of adrenaline mixed with breathtaking beauty, a high speed RIB (Rigid Inflatable Boat) safari is an unmissable Ulvik experience. After getting geared up in a warm, waterproof flotation suit, you’ll board the sturdy vessel right near the tender pier and blast off for an adventure into the heart of theHardangerfjord."
Ulvik Norway,9,https://diycruiseports.com/diy-port-guides/ulvik-norway-guide,p,"The journey first takes you out onto the main expanse of the Hardangerfjord, often called the “Queen of the Fjords.” From the water level, the scale of your surroundings is truly awe-inspiring. Steep, granite mountainsides plunge directly into the deep blue water, their peaks often shrouded in a light mist."
Ulvik Norway,9,https://diycruiseports.com/diy-port-guides/ulvik-norway-guide,p,"You’ll see a landscape dotted with tiny, colourful farmhouses clinging to the green slopes and countless “hanging” waterfalls that cascade down the cliffs like silver ribbons. The sheer size of the fjord, combined with the raw, unspoiled nature, makes you feel incredibly small in the best way possible!"
Ulvik Norway,9,https://diycruiseports.com/diy-port-guides/ulvik-norway-guide,p,"You’ll also see theHardanger Bridge, one of the longest suspension bridges in the world. The RIB will then veer into the narrower, more secludedOsafjord, a hidden gem branching off the main fjord, before returning back to Ulvik tender pier."
Ulvik Norway,9,https://diycruiseports.com/diy-port-guides/ulvik-norway-guide,p,"You have two choices at Ulvik – both should be pre-booked due to limited capacity: a“standard” 60-minute rideand alonger 2-hour ride. If you’ve never been on one, pick the shorter one. Been on a RIB before? Then I would pick the longer ride."
Ulvik Norway,9,https://diycruiseports.com/diy-port-guides/ulvik-norway-guide,p,"I’ve found that the longer rides in Norwegian ports are uncommon, probably because the port needs to be situated towards the end of a fjord to give the RIB room for a “long sprint”. The otherlong RIB ride is from Stavanger Cruise port to Lysefjord– another good choice."
Ulvik Norway,9,https://diycruiseports.com/diy-port-guides/ulvik-norway-guide,h3,3. Take a Breathtaking Fjord-View Hike
Ulvik Norway,9,https://diycruiseports.com/diy-port-guides/ulvik-norway-guide,p,"TheLiavegen/Jobykse Loopis a relatively easy hike of about 3 miles (~5km) return trip from Ulvik cruise pier. The loop starts and ends right in the Ulvik village centre, so no transport is needed."
Ulvik Norway,9,https://diycruiseports.com/diy-port-guides/ulvik-norway-guide,p,"The trail takes you along a section of the Fruit and Cider Route before ascending gently to offer panoramic views of the village and a truly spectacular viewpoint over the narrow, dramatic Osafjord. With a total ascent of about 300 meters, it’s a rewarding hike that won’t consume your entire day."
Ulvik Norway,9,https://diycruiseports.com/diy-port-guides/ulvik-norway-guide,p,"If you’d like to do this hike, grab a map or more info from the tourist info near Ulvik cruise pier."

Ulvik Norway,9,https://diycruiseports.com/diy-port-guides/ulvik-norway-guide,p,"The food scene in Ulvik is a perfect reflection of its landscape: authentic, high-quality, andhyper-local. The culinary philosophy is built around seasonal ingredients sourced directly from the surrounding farms."
Ulvik Norway,9,https://diycruiseports.com/diy-port-guides/ulvik-norway-guide,p,"You’ll hear the phrase “kortreist mat” (short-traveled food), and in Ulvik, some ingredients are so local they are simply “trillet ned fra gårdene” (rolled down from the farms). The stars of the menu are local lamb, fish from the fjord, and, of course, the incredible fruit and cider."
Ulvik Norway,9,https://diycruiseports.com/diy-port-guides/ulvik-norway-guide,p,"The dining experience here is deeply connected to the local agriculture. After walking theCider Route and visiting the farms, you can complete the circle by enjoying those very same products in a delicious meal. It’s atrue farm-to-table destination!"
Ulvik Norway,9,https://diycruiseports.com/diy-port-guides/ulvik-norway-guide,h3,Where to Eat Lunch
Ulvik Norway,9,https://diycruiseports.com/diy-port-guides/ulvik-norway-guide,p,"As you’ve probably gathered, there’s not that many options in Ulvik itself, due to the size of the town. Here’s two places within walking distance of Ulvik cruise pier – both are marked on myUlvik Cruise Port Mapabove:"

Ulvik Norway,9,https://diycruiseports.com/diy-port-guides/ulvik-norway-guide,p,"If none of the above activities interest you, I’m afraid that you’ll need to rely on your cruise line’s excursions. Due to Ulvik’s limited size, there’s very restricted capacity on local tours and almost all of which are booked up by the cruise line in advance."
Ulvik Norway,9,https://diycruiseports.com/diy-port-guides/ulvik-norway-guide,p,"Here’s what you’ll typically see on your cruise line’s “menu of excursions” at Ulvik –this is a guide only – be sure to read your cruise line’s description before you book, as each cruise line’s tour may vary slightly:"
Ulvik Norway,9,https://diycruiseports.com/diy-port-guides/ulvik-norway-guide,p,"Featured Image by Fjord Norway, Robin Strand – it’s the view of Ulvik on the Fruit and Cider route."
Ulvik Norway,9,https://diycruiseports.com/diy-port-guides/ulvik-norway-guide,p,"Ulvik isn’t the most exciting Norwegian Fjords port but it’s an amazing port of call if you treat it as a “light port day” (and recover from your other longer port days). So if you have Ulvik on your cruise itinerary, my suggestion would be to just use the day to enjoy the fjord views, with a gentle walk around the village or just chill with a glass of local cider! Enjoy your port day in Ulvik!"
