Ulvik Norway,9,https://www.nordicvisitor.com/norway/attractions/ulvik/,p,"The small hamlet ofUlviklies on the shores of the beautifulHardangerfjord, surrounded by gently rolling foothills and a high mountain plateau. Known for its idyllic orchards, Ulvik is a photographer's delight and is visited by cruise ships every summer."
Ulvik Norway,9,https://www.nordicvisitor.com/norway/attractions/ulvik/,p,"The area is famous for its fruit production, especially apples and cherries. In spring, the cherry blossom season transforms the terraces above the fjord into a sea of pink and white, attracting visitors and locals. Traditional wooden houses and farms hint at centuries of life shaped by the fjord and fertile land."
Ulvik Norway,9,https://www.nordicvisitor.com/norway/attractions/ulvik/,p,"The combination of the fjord, cliffs, rivers and orchards makes for a bird-watcher’s paradise. Sea eagles soar alongside herons, gulls, and cormorants. Inland, songbirds and finches benefit from a variety of fruit trees found in the surrounding orchards."
